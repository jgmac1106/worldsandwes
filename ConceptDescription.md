 ## Introduction

The Computer Science Department, Research Center on Computing and Society, and the School of Education at Southern Connecticut State University  submit this application to fund the creation of a Virtual Reality recording and editing studio and coursework on  storytelling and WebVR.

Specifically this project will fund the creation of the virtual reality lab and openly licensed pedagogical materials other computer science departments could use to learn ethics, webVR, or better yet both. Through these courses the students will create scalable, remixable content around issues of ethics in computer science in order to leave our programming understanding of ethics as a first-design principle.

The project will proceed in two stages. The Responsible Computer Science Challenge award will fund the first stage. During the first stage we will develop the animation and WebVR lab as well as develop the curriculum. Successful results of this stage will lead us to seek follow up funding to convert a planetarium into a dual purpose Virtual Reality live recording studio while maintaining planetarium functionality. 

Stage one, funded by the Responsible Computer Science Challenge is a formative design experiments that revolves around the pedagogical goal of understanding how perspectives, history, and personality shape ethics in computer science. 

Southern Connecticut State University is uniquely qualified for this award. Our Research Center on Computing and Society, founded and led by Terrell Ward Bynum, has explored the ethics of computer science and technology since 1988. Dr Heidi Lockwood, Professor of Philosophy will join the project. Dr. Lisa Lancor, Professor and Chair of the Computer Science Department will serve as Principal Investigator on the Project. Dr. Greg McVerry, Assistant Professor, Curriculum and Learning, and long time Mozilla contributor, will lead our efforts to facilitate the development course curriculum that align our long history exploring ethics and computer science with theories of open pedagogy.


## Theoretical Principles

In formative design experiments you develop a pedagogical goal around specific theories. We draw heavily on the work of John Dewey and see digital literacies and ethics in computer science as being necessary for efforts in democratic education. The pedagogy used will center around production based inquiry methods. We will also encourage all participants to reflect openly on a blogging platform and URL we will provide to participants. Further We will, in fact we already are, invite the larger Mozilla WebVR community to contribute to the project as well.

#### Why WebVR

We believe webVR to have the greatest reach and impact when teaching ethics. First of all the cost of full virtual reailoity rigs and the computer to power these systems are out of reach for most of the global population. WebVR will be accessible to anyone with a phone and Mozilla's virtual reality browser.

#### Open Pedagogy

Every participant will have their own website domain and a fully customizable content management system. Our  theoretical underpinning is that agency and belief in oneself as a writer is essential in order to engage in reflective thought required in ethics education. In todayâ€™s networked society (Castells & Cardozza, 2006), a new set of skills and practices have emerged, and we must design for diversity and inclusivity by acknowledging computer science has not been a safe space (boyd, 2018)

## Formative Design

 ### Collect Baseline Data

 We will begin with focus group interviews of students to examine their understanding of ethics in technology. To conduct these focus groups we will just layout the scenarios in our case study templates and record student discussion. We will then debrief the group and individual participants.

 ### Develop Learning Interventions

 We will then create and file the necessary paperwork for our new and revised courses. These courses will be designed in conjuction with our students and assigned a license that allows for remix. We will work with  Mozillians already creating content on Glitch to develop webVR tutorials.

 ### Implement Interventions

 We will then implement the courses and collect student feedback. The class will be open to SCSU for credit but open to global participants to play and contribute. Data will be triangulated using their blog posts and plus delta charts at multiple time points.

 ### Analyze Data

After the first run of classes we will analyze the data to determine which factors inhibited and which factors supported our pedagogical goals.

 ### Iterate on Learning Interventions

 We will then revise the coursework and run the classes again. 

 ### Analyze Data

 Finally we will analyze the data one last time using content analysis to identify themes that brought us closer to our pedagogical goals.
