 ## Introduction

The Computer Science Department, Research Center on Computing and Society, and the School of Education at Southern Connecticut State University  submit this application for aywill fund the fund the creation of a Virtual Reality recording and editing studio and the coursework storytelling and WebVR.

Specifically this project will fund the creation of the virtual reality lab and openly licensed pedagogical materials other computer science departments could use to learn ethics, webVR, or better yet both. Through these courses the students will create scalable, remixable content around issues of ethics in computer science in order to leave our programming understanding of ethics as a first-design principle.

The project will proceed in two stages. The Responsible Computer Science Challenge award will fund the first stage. During the first stage we will develop the animation and WebVR lab as well as develop the curriculum. Successful results of this stage will lead us to seek follow up funding to convert a planetarium into a dual purpose Virtual Reality live recording studio while mantaining the traditioanl planetary functionality. This will involve mounting two 4k digital displays and will allow for mixed use digital imagery for almost any field.

Stage one of the project, which will be funded by the The Responsible Computer Science Challenge is a formative design experiments that revolve around the pedagogical goal of understanding a perspectives, history, and personality shape the role of ethics in the classoom. In phase one we will develop the curriculum to learn WebVR through the lens of ethics in Computter Science

Southern Connecticut State University is uniquely qualified for this award. Our Research Center on Computing and Society, founded and led by Terrell Ward Bynum, has explored the ethics of computer science and technology since 1988. Dr Heidi Lockwood, Professor of Philosophy will join the project. Dr. Lisa Lancor, Professor and Chair of the Computer Science Department will serve as Principal Investigator on the Project. Dr. Greg McVerry, Assistant Professor, Curriculum and Learning, and long tiem Mozilla contributor, will lead our efforts to facilitate the development course curriculum that align our long history exploring ethics and computer science with theories of open pedagogy.


## Theoertical Principles

In formative design experiments you develop a pedagogical goal around specific theories. We draw heavily on the work of John Dewey and see digital literacies and ethics in computer science as being necessary for efforts in democratic education. The pedagogy used will center around production based inquiry methods. We will also encourage all participants to reflect openly on a blogging platform and URL we will provide to participants. Further We will, in fact we already are, invite the larger Mozilla WebVR community to contribute to the project as well.

#### Why WebVR

#### Open Pedgagoy

Every participant will have their own website domain and a fully customizable content management system. Our  theoretical underpinning is that agency and belief in oneself as a writer is essential in order to engage in reflective thought required in ethics education. In todayâ€™s networked society (Castells & Cardozza, 2006), a new set of skills and practices have emerged, and we must design for diversity and inclusivity by acknowledging computer science has not been a safe space (boyd, 2018)
