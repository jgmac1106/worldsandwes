# Project Title: Shaping our Worlds and Exploring Our We(s): WebVR and Computer science Ethics
## Name of Principal Investigator (PI):Lisa Lancor
- PI Department or Program:
- Computer Science
## Amount Requested (USD): $147,378.00
### Total Project Budget (USD): $147,378.00

### Project Purpose:

Through this project, SCSU computer science students will develop ethical case studies in CS using webVR and share these with others. 

### Concept Summary:

This project will fund the creation of a Virtual Reality recording and editing lab and the development of undergraduate courses in film, recording, animation, and a course in webVR. Through these courses the students will create scalable, remixable content around issues of ethics in computer science in order to leave our programming understanding of ethics as a first-design principle .The project will proceed in two phases. During the first phase, we will convert an unused planetarium into a a webVR classroom. This will mean installing high-end video cameras, switches, additional networking, recording, and computer editing equipment.

In phase two of the class, we will develop the course syllabi for a two-course sequence in webVR that will revolve around students scripting, animating, and filming case studies about ethics in computer science. These courses will be cross-listed with our Philosophy Departmentâ€™s studies in the ethics of technology.

To advance the goals of these challenges, we will be making our curriculum and lesson plans openly licensed and available to other computer science programs across the globe using Glitch. The syllabi, coursework, and student projects will also be made available on GitHub. Any course work developed by the instructors with funds from the grant will be openly licensed. Students will have the right to choose their license.

The pedagogy used will center around production based inquiry methods. As the PIs develop the curriculum they will write two model case studies: ethics, license, and open source, sustainability, the web, and block chain. In the first case study students will watch discussions of open source and examine elements of privilege and privacy. In the second case study students will take part in a simulation that compares energy use on a web based on HTML and a web based on blockchain technologies.

Students will then use the new laboratory to write and develop other ethical case studies using webVR. Computer science programs across the globe can complete the case studies, remix them, or use the curriculum to design their own.

As they embark on this journey students will reflect on portfolios they build themselves using Glitch.

WebVR provides a fascinating platform for developing a culture of ethics in in computer science. Not only can students be placed in situations that maybe amoral in real life but they can reflect on practices as they develop case studies from historical research


### Deliverables:

* Virtual reality recording studio
* webVR editing stations
* Approximately 15 webVR case studies on ethics in computer science
* Two course sequence on developing webVR with a lens towards ethics
* Network of student blogs, reflections, and posts.
* Integrated reading and writing environment for teacher and the students.

      

### Suitability:

We make perfect partners for the project. The project is co-sponsored by the Computer Science Department, The Research Center on Computer and Society, and the School of Education

Dr. Lisa Lancor, Chair of the Computer Science Department and Principal Investigator, teaches a class on "Ethical Hacking & Penetration Testing." and is considered an international expert on the intersection of ethics, computer science, and teaching.Dr. Lancor's faculty have developed curriculum around the use of virtual reality technologies. 

The Research Center on Computing & Society is dedicated to the advancement of computer ethics as an academic discipline and to the ethical use of computer technology. The center runs the nations oldest conference on ethics and technology. Dr. Heidi Lockwood, professor of Philosophy will help 

Southern Connecticut state University School of Education  has had a long relationship with Mozilla. Mozilla Foundation's code editor, Thimble, underwent extensive development and user testing in our college classrooms. Dr. J. Gregory McVerry, our Pedagogy Director, was selected as part of the inaugural #MOZ50 celebrating the fifty Mozillians who best supported the networks efforts around Internet Health. We instill the values of the Mozilla Manifesto into the students at SCSU out of a sense of duty as a campus focused on #SocialJustice.
