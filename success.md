While traditional instructional design places a  learning objectives ethics in computer science can never work this. Inclusion should never be a rubric. No one should get a 2.7 proficient in diversity score. Creative a culture of ethics as a first principle of design requires us to reshape society and not learners.

A focus on instructionism as Gary Stager points out (2005 pg 3)in education using the web leads to "delivering re-purposed content to students via the	Internet. Communication, collaboration,	community	and	construction are after thoughts graded onto modern correspondence courses."

This data fetishization is a symptom of society rooted in the same problem that lead to the lack of ethics in computer science. Being a good doesn't exist on a Likert scale it develops on a human scale

Therefore rather than specific learner objectives we will work with participants to set their "subjectives" (Cormier, 2015) and let them determine the goals in a class that is
> * **Collaborative** – everyone, including	the	instructor,	learns together	and	takes responsibility for everyone else’s learning.		
> * **Documented** - the processes of learning are more important that the specifics of the knowledge	constructed. The learning process, therefore, is documented in the...
> * **Open** - by exposing learning to colleagues and the public, students take the first steps in taking control of their digital identity and expanding their horizons as	connected learners-John Becker, 2016.

The class and community we create will teach more about ethics than any specific content. By utilizing case studies we can connect our community with multiple perspectives and allow for a process of growth and self-remediation yet we must live these lessons to the spaces and tools we build. 

## Space as Variable of Interest

As our focus is more on measuring success in our spaces of learning we will ask learners to plot how they feel the class supports learners in growing on the following scales: 
* Lead
  * Learn
  * Teach
  * Innovate
  * Evangelize
  * Organize
* Communicate
  * Inquiry
  * Identify
  * Position
  * Empathize
  * Engage
* Think
  * Question
  * Reflect
  * Analyze
  * Decide
  * Change
* Create
  * Build
  * Test
  * Iterate
  * Differentiate
  * Scale

We will create a simple web app for participants to record not where they feel the majority of students engage with the participatory learning environments. After each class students will simply click on across each of the four scales. We will use this data to iterate on how we meet our pedagogical goals.

## Curating Evidence of Success

Each week all participants will be asked to select a picture and write a brief not explaining how the picture captures how they feel. Using content analysis and semiotic analysis we will explore the visual metaphors participants choose. This will provide evidence of knowledge growth from participants. This task is also designed to reinforce visual thinking in the creation of case studies.

## Parsing for Growth

Being that A-Frame is written in declarative HTML we will be able to track knowledge growth by using HTML parsers and a type of metadata called microformats. These will be included in both the case study templates, student blogs, and the A-Frame starter kits.

We will also be able to track the number of changes students make using the history available to us in both Git and Glitch. 

## Webmention badges 

We will also create a platform to issue badges. These have been piloted and successfully deployed. All class instructional pages will accept webmentions. Students will apply for a badge by writing a post in reply to the course explaining how they met criteria. If they met the criteria a webmention badge will be sent in reply to the application and to the students badge display page.

## Circuit of Reflective Inquiry

Ethics requires a study of self and society through a process of self-remediation and democratic education. As we try to measure success of these efforts in Computer Science we attempt to use multiple pieces of evidence that still put agency in the learner to focus on their subjectives. In this approach we hope to measure growth through Gee's circuit of reflective action:
> we formulate a goal (and the goal could be answering a question) and then we take an action in the world. We see how the world responds to the action, ask ourselves whether this response was good or not for the accomplishment of our goal, and then, if need be, act again on better information or a redefined goal. The circuit of reflective action is an interactive conversation with the world.
