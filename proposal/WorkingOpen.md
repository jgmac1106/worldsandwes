We will open this project to the wider computer science and WebVR world. In fact, as we write this proposal, we welcome Pull Requests and issues at [GitHub](https://github.com/jgmac1106/worldsandwes) 

### Open Begins on Your Own Domain
As we develop this project, all participants will be encouraged to blog and share their reflections and learnings.  We believe working open involves not only "documenting and sharing your concept with broader audiences",  but inviting  audiences to get involved and help shape both the project and our openly networked space for learning.

To this end, all participants from the PI to each student will be given a URL and a blog. We will use a social reader and technologies called Micropub and Microsub to connect learners.  

### Open Pedagogy
The two courses designed for this class will carry an open license. In fact, they will be built using readily available tools. Members of Mozilla's WebVR community have already expressed interest in both designing and taking the course.

### Open Data and Privacy
No participant will be required to share openly and will have full control to license their own content as long as they meet the requirements of any reused code or previously licensed content.
