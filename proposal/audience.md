# Student Audience

At SCSU, we design for a future where there is no separate tech industry, for we embrace the truth of the present that every industry is now a tech industry. Therefore, CSC 105: Digital Storytelling, our entry level class in the program will be offered to all students as part of our Liberal Education Program.  This class will focus on the structure of storytelling, character development, and storytelling.

We will fork and also participate in the online class [#DS106](http://ds106.us/). This distributed learning community is the longest continuously running class on the web and will connect our SCSU students to open web advocates from across the globe. These students will be invited to join our efforts at developing ethical case studies using traditional new media.

We will also develop and propose a new advanced elective course, CSC 318: Virtual Reality, that will focus on learning A-Frame and WebVR. While students in this course will not develop their own case studies, they will take storyboards and scripts written by students in CSC 105 or DS106 and apply greater disciplinary and tier-three academic language to the resources and then develop the WebVR content using the proposed editing studio funded by this grant.

As previously mentioned, all of our computer science undergraduate majors are required to complete our CSC 324: Computer Ethics course. We propose that all of the MVP case studies developed as part of this grant will be deployed in this class.  As new modules are created by students, we plan to vet them and incorporate them into other required computer science classes, when possible.

Furthermore, all sections of the two proposed courses (CSC 105 and CSC 318) will be taught openly on the web. Anyone globally can enroll in these classes. In fact, we already have an expressed interest from members of the Mozilla Virtual Reality community who would like to get involved as both, participants and designers.

All the material we create from this class, including participant blogs, will be made openly available on the Glitch platform and GitHub. We have already started to work with collaborators who have created A-Frame tutorials and host these files on Glitch as well. Participants will maintain the right to license their content  however they choose.

This strategy of providing locally curated content that we also open to the web at large will lead to the greatest number of students to be involved in the grant. Working openly also provides a greater voice for our students to get involved in the design of the classes and the projects. Additionally, the SCSU Computer Science Club has expressed an interest and reported to the department that they would like instruction in virtual reality. Any student member can join the steering committee simply by showing up to a meeting or filing a pull request on the team repo.

We also hope computer science, philosophy, business or education schools take up and use the case studies developed by our students. While we believe the learning and knowledge students gain by creating, editing and animating their videos will lead to greater knowledge growth, we will also develop the curriculum for programs that would just like to utilize our series of case studies.

The tutorials on A-Frame and WebVR that we propose to develop, in conjunction with the Mozilla Virtual Reality community, will also reach thousands across the globe. Having these tutorials framed around examples of ethics will further reinforce the concept that diversity and inclusion need to be a first design principle.

While traditional instructional design places a priority on learning objectives, ethics in computer science can never work this way. Inclusion should never be a rubric. No one should get a “2.7 proficient in diversity” score. Creating a culture of ethics as a first principle of design requires us to reshape society and not learners.

As Gary Stager points out (2005, pg. 3), a focus on instructionism (e.g. teacher-focused, non-interactive and highly prescribed) in education using the web leads to "delivering re-purposed content to students via the Internet. Communication, collaboration, community and construction are afterthoughts graded onto modern correspondence courses."

This data fetishization is a symptom of society rooted in the same problem that lead to the lack of ethics in computer science. Being good person doesn't exist on a Likert scale; it develops on a human scale.  Therefore, rather than specific learner objectives, we will work with participants to set their "subjectives" (Cormier, 2015) and let them determine the goals in a class that is:
*	Collaborative – everyone, including the instructor, learns together and takes responsibility for everyone else’s learning.
*	Documented - the processes of learning are more important that the specifics of the knowledge constructed. The learning process, therefore, is documented.
*	Open - by exposing learning to colleagues and the public, students take the first steps in taking control of their digital identity and expanding their horizons as connected learners (John Becker, 2016).

The class and community we create will teach more about ethics than any specific content. By utilizing case studies, we can connect our community with multiple perspectives and allow for a process of growth and self-remediation yet we must live these lessons to the spaces and tools we build.
