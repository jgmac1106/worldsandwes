We seek to improve internet health by focusing our project around ethics in computing. In keeping with Mozillaâ€™s mission of maintaining internet health, our proposed project supports the 5 key elements in content and/or delivery, namely: (1) Privacy & Security, (2) Openness, (3) Decentralization, (4) Digital Inclusion and (5) Web Literacy.  

The curriculum will certainly focus on privacy & security as a principle of first design. A core concept is the professional, ethical and social responsibilities of technologists who often have access to sensitive data. However, just talking about the importance of securing data in our existing computer ethics course is one thing but building immersive scenarios around privacy and security can be a powerful learning experience.  For example, consider visualizing in 3D, a data breach with sensitive medical records streaming out of a secured network from a SQL injection attack due to careless coding that lacks input validation on a web form.  An interactive application would allow us to have the stolen medical records belong to the viewer with his/her name on them.  This has the potential to be unforgettable.

Areas of diversity and inclusion will also get taught as a principle of first design. WebVR provides a useful avenue for this approach as we can put hypothetical characters in situations that would not be ethical to do with real humans. Furthermore, early research in counseling, PTSD, and autism finds virtual reality may help to improve empathy.

While the price point on high-end virtual reality rigs continues to fall, the cost is still inaccessible to almost 100% of the world population. This is why we propose to create A-Frame content to develop our initial case studies as models and encourage students to do the same. Thus, anyone with a smartphone and a compatible lens can access our WebVR content. The use of a WebVR-first approach also allows us to reach a much larger audience with our message of ethics in computer science.

The MVP case studies that we propose to develop with our students include:
*	Greening the Web: Do you really need React or Blockchain when HTML will do?
*	Rush to Release:  Stay quiet when you know about a security vulnerability?
*	False Positives: Do Algorithms protect us?

Our students will then work in distributed teams with open participants across the web to create additional case studies.
