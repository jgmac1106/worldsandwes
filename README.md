Southern Connecticut state University School of Education has had a long relationship with Mozilla. Mozilla Foundation's code editor, Thimble, underwent extensive development and user testing in our college classrooms. Dr. J. Gregory McVerry, our Pedagogy Director, was selected as part of the inaugural #MOZ50 celebrating the fifty Mozillians who best supported the networks efforts around Internet Health. We instill the values of the Mozilla Manifesto into the students at SCSU out of a sense of duty as a campus focused on #SocialJustice.
