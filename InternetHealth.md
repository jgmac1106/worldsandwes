How does your approach make the internet healthier? (2500 Characters or Fewer)

In a recent survey on Internet Health, specifically the future of connected devices, Mozilla found that those who identify as "ultra-nerds" are more optimistic about the web than those not always online. This result mirror's danah boyd's twenty anniversary critique of John Berry Barlow's original manifesto. Ultra-nerds come from a place of privilege, and this usually means white, male, and from the global north. We never designed the web for diversity because the original designers had never felt threatened, were never stalked. This explains why even today Amnesty International find female journalists get attacked every ten seconds online

> In college I did have a stalker. It was a very scary experience. I come to technology with a different perspective because of that experience. It is not a matter of techno panic but a matter of self-preservation....lots of people in Silicon Valley who have never had a Stalker. They are not thinking like that. If you get more people involved that have had Diversity improves technology in a way that makes regulation less necessary [Stacey Higginbotham, This Week in Google](https://twit.tv/shows/this-week-in-google).

We seek to improve internet health by ensuring ethics, especially the areas of diversity and inclusion, gets taught as a principle of first design. WebVR provides a useful avenue for this approach as we can put hypothetical characters in situations that would not be ethical to do to real humans. Furthermore early research into counseling, PTSD, and autism finds virtual reality may help to improve empathy. 

We will utilize a series of case studies as models and encourage students to record and create aframe content. The use of a webVR first approach also allows us to reach a much larger audience with our message of ethics in computer science. While the pricepoint on high end virtual reality rig will fall the cost makes it inaccessible to almost 100% of the world population. Anyone with a smartphone and a compatible lens can use WebVR.

Our MVP case studies we propose and will develop with our students include:
* Greening the Web: Do you really need React or Blockchain when HTML will do?
* Code of Conduct: Better conferences or Kangaroo Court?
* False Positives: Do Algorithm's protect us?

Our students will then work in distributed teams with open participants across the web to create additional case studies.
