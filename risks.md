## Risks

As a university sponsored  project all research activity funded by this grant will require approval from an Instutional Review Board and any consent and assesnt from participants. 

### Humane Tech isn't Engineered

Mindsets do not shift easily. Many developers look to engineer their way to the perfect social solution. This world belief that, "Code can save the world, but only I can write it," traces its roots, as Sara Wachter-Boettcher (2017) points out back to bias engineered into computer science since the 1950's when psychologist identified loner men as the most apt for programming and then built assessments to identify these types of employees. Yet subtle concepts of bias of perfection, impostor syndrome to explicit bias around competition, verbal discourse, and  nuerodiversity have weeded their way through all of our history (Banaji & Greenwald, 2017).

We can not code our way to better community. While what we engineer reflects our bias engineering alone can never overcome perspectives and pasts. Instead we must carve anew; placing our principles before our pull requests.  To overcome the  risk of settled mindsets we will first put a focus on listening to voices who tech does not serve or has not served safely. 

We will then root the story of ethics in Computer Science into the narratives of at risk populations. We will study the shape of the story and come to understand how the prescriptive technologies (Ursula, 2004) control the shape of stories we tell. We will then create narratives through the webVR case studies.

This does introduce the risk of too many possibilities. Amy Burvall notes that constraints lead to greater creativity. We will mitigate this risk by first focusing on creating webVR using aFrame technologies as a proof of concept before scaling up to a full virtual reality recording studio. 

However we will provide everyone with a Domain of their own and a blog to ensure they own their stories.

### Interdisciplinary Approach

Our use of webVR and aFrame will require computer science engineers to study digital story telling and narratology while English and education majors study computer science. The populations served by many community colleges and state universities in the United States have multiple jobs and families to raise. Adding additional domains of knowledge to already crowded curriculum can add stress to the lives of students.

To mitigate these risks we will add additional scaffolds, a network of open participants, bi-monthly face to face meetings, and on-demand video tutorials. Plus we will stress importance of community in Open Pedagogy and encourage participants to rely on each other and the knowledge we create and curate together. 

### Open and Privacy

Online communication, such as tweets, blog posts, and comments are generally out in the open and technically “public” and available for researchers to analyze and quote. Internet researchers have, however, documented how a particular communication may be technically public but viewed by the individual who posted it as meant for a more limited or private context. 

Even if an individual feels that they have “published” in public or have consented to be part of research, they might still feel like trust has been violated if their words are taken up and re-framed in a way that they feel is out of context or misrepresented. While this study will seek IRB approval we also have stringent rules around user sat:

* We will analyze and publish data that is de-identified or aggregated in ways that cannot be traced back to an individual.
* Any identifiable quotes or descriptions of activities will not be used in a research publication or presentation without the permission of the individual. This includes anonymized or pseudonymized quotes, because they can be linked back through a search engine to an individual public posting.

Participants  may also be contacted and recruited to participate in surveys and interviews for specific research studies. In these cases we will offer a clear explanation of the consent and privacy procedures, how the data will be used, and what benefit the research will provide to the individual and the #WalkMyWorld community. The researcher should also consider offering interviewees the opportunity to review transcripts and quotes.

No student will be required to join the study. In fact someone beside the class instructor will collect permissions and the teaching professor will not know who agreed to be included until grades are submitted. 

In fact participants may be asked to complete an additional consent form which was reviewed and approved by our Institutional Review Board. This is an independent group  at every college and university that ensures participants are protected when faculty and staff conduct research.
