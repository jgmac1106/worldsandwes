How many students will you reach through this effort? Who are they? Did you engage any students to help shape the design of your concept? (5000 Characters or Fewer)

At Southern Connecticut State University we design for a future where there is no tech industry for we embrace the truth of the present that every industry is now a tech industry. Therefore our entry level class in the program will be offered to all students as part of our Liberal Education Program. This class will focus on the structure of storytelling, character development, and story telling.

We will fork and also participate in the online class #DS106. This distributed learning community is the longest continuously running class on the web and will connect our Southern students to open web advocates from across the globe. These students will be invited to join our efforts at developing ethical case studies using traditional new media. 

All of  our Computer Science undergraduate and graduate students take a class in computer ethics. All the case studies developed as part of this grant will be deployed in this class to be used by all of our computer science classes.

We will also revise our graduate level ethical hacking class to include case studies specifically around the ethics of privacy and security. Every computer science graduate class offers this program.

We will also develop and propose a new class on learning aFrame and WebVR. While students will not complete case studies in this class they will take storyboards and scripts students wrote in DS106, apply greater disciplinary and tier three academic language, then develop the webVR files using the editing studio funded by this grant.

Furthermore all sections of these four classes will be taught openly on the web. Anyone globally can enroll in these classes. In fact we already have an expressed interest from members of the Mozilla Virtual Reality community who would like to get involved as both participants and designers.

All the material we create from this class, including participant blogs will be made openly available on the Glitch platform and GitHub. We have already started to work with collaborators who have created aFrame tutorials and host these files on Glitch as well. Participants will maintain the right to license their content in how they choose. 

This strategy of providing locally curated content that we also open to the web at large will lead to the greatest number of students to be involved in the grant. Working openly also provides a greater voice for our students to get involved in the design of the classes and the projects. The SCSU computer science club has expressed an interest and reported to the department they would like instruction in virtual reality. Any student member can join the steering committee simply by showing up to a meeting or filing a pull request on the team repo.
